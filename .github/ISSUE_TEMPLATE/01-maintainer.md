**PLEASE USE GITHUB DISCUSSIONS FOR BUG REPORTS AND FEATURE REQUESTS.**

See <https://github.com/swsnr/turnon/discussions>.

As a maintainer, I reserve Github issues for fully specified actionable issues
which are ready to be worked on, and which I intend to address sooner or later.

Please do not create issues for bug reports and feature requests; refer to
Github discussions for these. If a bug is confirmed and reproduced, or a
feature request fully specified, and if I then intend to actually work on it,
I'll open a corresponding issue.

I'll close any other issues without warning or explanation.
